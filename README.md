# Security Labs

## About this repository

Security Labs is a collection of **step-by-step guides and practical labs** focused on **securing Kubernetes clusters**, especially in cloud environments such as **AKS, EKS, and GKE**. The goal is to provide **technical, validated, and applicable** content that helps security professionals protect Kubernetes workloads from threats like **ransomware, misconfigurations, and insider attacks**.

Each section contains **tested configurations, automation scripts, and security best practices**, ensuring a high standard of technical validation.
